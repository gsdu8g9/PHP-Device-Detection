PHP Device Detection
====================

PHP Device Detection (for Modern Platforms)
- detect mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- detect Windows, Macintosh, Android, iOS and ChromeOS Operating Systems
- detect Chrome, Internet Explorer (5-11+), Safari, Opera and Firefox Browsers
- detect Trident, WebKit, Presto, Gecko Layout Engines

This simple php library class supports the major and most popular platforms.

Also Supports the new Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) which no longer uses MSIE as its identifier.



Todo: 
- Support for Bots (googlebot, bingbot, yahoobot, etc) 
- Support more browsers + OS


(I am using this application on thousands of users to see which popular user-agents are bypassing the detection)
